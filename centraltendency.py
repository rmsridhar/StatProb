#In statistics, skewness and kurtosis are two ways to measure the shape of a distribution.

#Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of a distribution.
#This value can be positive or negative.

#A negative skew indicates that the tail is on the left side of
#the distribution, which extends towards more negative values.
#A positive skew indicates that the tail is on the right side
#of the distribution, which extends towards more positive values.
#A value of zero indicates that there is no skewness in the
#distribution at all, meaning the distribution is perfectly symmetrical.
#If skewness is less than -1 or greater than 1,
#the distribution is highly skewed.
#If skewness is between -1 and -0.5 or between 0.5 and 1,
#the distribution is moderately skewed.
#If skewness is between -0.5 and 0.5, the distribution is approximately symmetric.
   
#Kurtosis is a measure of whether or not a distribution is
#heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution.

#The kurtosis of a normal distribution is 3.
#If a given distribution has a kurtosis less than 3,
#it is said to be playkurtic, which means it tends to produce
#fewer and less extreme outliers than the normal distribution.
#If a given distribution has a kurtosis greater than 3,
#it is said to be leptokurtic, which means it tends to produce
#more outliers than the normal distribution.
#Note: Some formulas (Fisherâ€™s definition) subtract 3 from the kurtosis
#to make it easier to compare with the normal distribution.
#Using this definition, a distribution would have kurtosis greater
#than a normal distribution
#The values for asymmetry and kurtosis between -2 and +2
#are considered acceptable in order to prove normal univariate distribution
